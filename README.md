## General Information

Bézier curves are smooth curves often used in graphic design, animation, and manufacturing. These curves are created by connecting several control points, which determine the shape and direction of the curve.

With building Bézier curves, we can learn about the algorithm used to create the curve, which is the Midpoint Algorithm. This algorithm is used to create a Bézier curve using the Divide and Conquer method and the Brute Force method. The Divide and Conquer method is a method that divides the problem into smaller subproblems, solves the subproblems, and then combines the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem. The Brute Force method is a method that solves the problem by trying all possible solutions and selecting the best solution.
